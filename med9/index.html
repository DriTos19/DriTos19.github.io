<p><img src="flamingo1.jpg">There are 6 spieces of flamingos: The greater flamingo, the lesser flamingo, the chilean flamingo, James's flamingo, the andean flamingo and the american flamingo. Flamingos stay in cold water and for some unkown reason most of the time they stand in one leg. They live in groups and are very social, they form colonies to be safer from predators. They form strong pair bonds but when they're in colonies they change.<img class="flamingo2" src="flamingo2.jpg" Before breeding, flamingo colonies split into breeding groups of> about 15 to 50 birds. Both males and females in these groups perform synchronized ritual displays. partners 
After the chicks hatch, the only parental expense is feeding, both parents feed the chicks with some kind of milk <img src="flamingo3.jpg">
